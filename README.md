This Grocery Point of Sale System Project requires the system users to enter their registered system user credentials in order to access the features and functionalities of the system. 
Users can manage the list of Product Categories, Categories, and Sales Transactions. actions are executed using jQuery's Ajax requests. 

The application also generates a ready-to-print receipt of the transaction details. The receipt will be shown after the user saves a transaction and they can also re-print the receipt on the Sales List Page. The system generates a transaction code automatically upon saving the record. The system also shows the summary or the data total counts in the Home/Dashboard Page. The said page also contains the overall transactions in the current date and the Total Sum of the Transactions.
